<div><p style="margin-right:10px"> <img src="/assets/images/me_pumpkin.png" style="width:40%; height:40%; float:left; margin-right:50px; margin-left:30px;"> Hi! My name is Ian Phillips, I am a third year Material Science & Engineering undergraduate, with a Chemical Engineering focus.</p>
</br><p>I work as the TA for an engineering design course in D-Lab, and build my research experience growing Topological Insulator crystals for Taufour Physics lab. I have a strong interest in entrepreneurship and innovation, leading me to become a self-taught web designer and pick up intro C++, Python, and JAVA.</p>
</br><p>I currently serve as the President of the Davis Motorsports Club, and rebuild broken bicycles in my spare time. I hope to one day have a shop of my own, to machine auto parts and build my engineering ideas.</p>
</br><p>My professional and personal interests often overlap, ranging from sustainable energy, automotive, and novel material research to entrepreneurship, bicycles, and music. Over the years, I have played guitar, trumpet and trombone!</p>
